1.2,"The right-hand pane should have a fixed position, it should not scroll when the user scrolls up or down"
1.2.1,"Only the main pane should scroll up or down, when the changes the scrollbar"

1.5.1,"It should have 4 ""principal"" quarters like slices of a cake that bisect the middle, each quarter should correspond to a zones progress"
1.5.2,"Each quarter should be sliced into three ""sub-quarters"", each quarter represents the progress of all voices through the zone."
1.5.3,"For example, if one voice has entered the zone, one sub-quarter should be colored in, and if two voices have entered, 2 sub-quarters, and when 3 voices have entered the entire ""primary quarter should be colored in."
15.4,"The quarter should remain colored in when the voice cards leave zone 1 for 2, to indicated that processing in zone 1 is complete"
1.5.6,"Likewise, when users begin to move voice cards into zone 2, the subquarters should be progressively colored in the same manner, and so on for zone 3 and 4."

1.6.1,"Later I will add some conditions for when a voic card cannot be dragged past the wall, so keep this in mind, but for the time being call cards can be dragged past the wall. "
